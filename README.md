This is the readme file for alx low-level projects.
This file lists present projects in this repository.

Understand that this file might not provide you for specific projects details.
You can easily jump to a particular project if you want further information on it.

You'll also notice that each available project is a folder, and
has its own readme file that explain more about what the project is, what files it contains along with
the function used in them.

That's being said Happy Hacking!
